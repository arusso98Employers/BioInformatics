# Bioinformatic Algorithms, Databases, and Tools

Computers have revolutionized modern biological research, by providing biologists with the means to manage and analyze the large amounts of data generated through high-throughput experiments. This course provides a practical introduction to the main algorithms, databases, and tools used in bioinformatics, at the same time providing insight into the biological problems being addressed.

Examples included:

Burrows Wheelser Transform: The BWT is a data transformation algorithm that restructures data in such a way that the transformed message is more compressible. Technically, it is a lexicographical reversible permutation of the characters of a string. It is first of the three steps to be performed in succession while implementing the Burrows-Wheeler Data Compression algorithm that forms the basis of the Unix compression utility bzip2.

Cyclic peptides: Polypeptide chains taking cyclic ring structure. The ring structure can be formed by linking one end of the peptide and the other with an amide bond, or other chemically stable bonds such as lactone, ether, thioether, disulfide, and so on. The code written can successfully process these structures.

Lloyd's algorithm: also known as Voronoi iteration or relaxation, is an algorithm named after Stuart P. Lloyd for finding evenly spaced sets of points in subsets of Euclidean spaces and partitions of these subsets into well-shaped and uniformly sized convex cells Like the closely related k-means clustering algorithm
